I am a Staff Research Scientist at IBM Research - India. I work on networking, cloud research. I completed my PhD at National University of Singapore (Thesis topic:"Improving Network Diagnostics using Programmable Networks") under the guidance of Prof. Chan Mun Choon. My Research is on Programmable Networks, Software Defined Networking, Network Virtualization and Mobile Communication technologies. 

Prior to my PhD Adventure, I was working with Cisco Systems, Bangalore, for 4 years. At Cisco, I worked on infrastructure and virtualization R&D in core and edge routers(GSR and ASR). 

I was brought up at Chennai, a buzzing coastal Metro, which is located in South India.
