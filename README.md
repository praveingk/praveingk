I am a Research Fellow at CIR Lab under School of Computing, National University of Singapore. I completed my PhD (Thesis topic:"Improving Network Diagnostics using Programmable Networks")  under the guidance of Prof. Chan Mun Choon. My Research is on Programmable Networks, Software Defined Networking, Network Virtualization and Mobile Communication technologies. 

Prior to my PhD Adventure, I was working with Cisco Systems, a major Networking company located in Bangalore, for 4 years. At Cisco, I worked on infrastructure and Virtualization R&D in core and edge routers(GSR and ASR). 

I was brought up at Chennai, a buzzing coastal Metro, which is located in South India. I am married to Sneha Muralidharan, who is also currently pursuing her PhD in Department of Biological Sciences, NUS.
